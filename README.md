Welcome to DIGITALGEEKERY! This is a collection of scripts I've built over the years — nothing special, just stuff that worked for me or helped solve an issue at the time. You'll find a mix of PowerShell and batch scripts, all designed to make IT life a bit easier. Feel free to dig in, use what you need, and tweak it to fit your own setup.

If you're interested in more insights, tips, and IT stories, check out my blog over at digitalgeekery.com. It’s all about practical solutions for real-world IT problems.
